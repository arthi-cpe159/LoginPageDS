User Authentication and Session Management API
This repository contains the code for an API designed to authenticate users, exchange public and private keys, store user data securely, and initiate sessions for authenticated users.

Entity: User
The User entity represents a registered user of the application. Each user has a unique identifier, username, password, and public and private keys for secure communication with the API.

Controller: Authentication
The Authentication controller is responsible for authenticating users and exchanging public and private keys. It provides endpoints for user login, key exchange, and session initiation.

Controller: User Management
The User Management controller is responsible for managing user data, such as creating new user accounts and retrieving user information. It provides endpoints for creating new users, retrieving user data, and updating user data.

Controller: Session Management
The Session Management controller is responsible for initiating and managing sessions for authenticated users. It provides endpoints for starting and ending sessions, as well as for retrieving session data.

Spring Boot MongoDB API
This repository contains the code for a Spring Boot API designed to interact with a MongoDB database. The API provides endpoints for performing CRUD operations on a collection of documents in the database.

Installation
To install and run the API locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone.
Install the necessary dependencies using mvn install.
Ensure that MongoDB is installed and running on your local machine.
Create a MongoDB database and collection to store the documents for the API.
Start the server using mvn spring-boot:run.
After completing these steps, the API should be up and running and ready to accept requests at http://localhost:8080. You can test the API using a tool like Postman or by sending requests directly from your client application.

Conclusion
This API provides a secure and reliable method for authenticating users, exchanging public and private keys, storing user data, and initiating sessions. It can be easily integrated into a larger application or used as a standalone authentication and session management service.
